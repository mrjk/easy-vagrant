Each commit message must have a maximum lenght of 72 characters. The title must follow the imperative at the present tense. The title must start with an uppercase letter, and there is no dot at the end of the sentence. An easy way to remember is: ''if applied, this commit will <commit_title>''. Optionnaly, it is a good practice to add some explanations of what the commit do.
