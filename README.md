  generation


Each commit message must have a maximum lenght of 72 characters. The title must follow the imperative at the present tense. The title must start with an uppercase letter, and there is no dot at the end of the sentence. An easy way to remember is: ''if applied, this commit will <commit_title>''. Optionnaly, it is a good practice to add some explanations of what the commit do.

## Credits
The initial idea came to me when I was working for one of my customer. If I remember well, I made an initial version from the work of [Scott Lowe](http://blog.scottlowe.org/2016/01/14/improved-way-yaml-vagrant/). Since I lost this work into my archives, I made a new version from this idea thanks to [Julian Gut](http://juliangut.com/blog/configure-vagrant-hosts-yaml). I was still unhappy with its approach, and I wanted something way mush simpler (in term of files) and more powerful. Then easy-vagrant came to life.

Easy-vagrant is a sort of vagrant-skel, obviously made by skel (:
